Description: This package provides methods for analyzing multi-objective optimization data.
    First, methods are provided to analyze optimization data obtained through bottleneck identification by the SCORE
    method. Secondly, an interactive Shiny application is available to perform knowledge-driven optimization on
    multi-objective optimization data. The goal of the Shiny application is to provide a reproducible analysis
    based on filtering, clustering, visualization, rule extraction and export.
